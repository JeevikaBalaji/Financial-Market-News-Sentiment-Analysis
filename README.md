## Introduction

The **Financial Market News Sentiment Analysis** project aims to classify news headlines related to financial markets into sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis helps gauge public perception and market reactions based on news coverage. This project was implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** with a machine learning approach, achieving an accuracy of **52%**.

## Key Features
- Classifies financial news headlines into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data.
- Implements machine learning algorithms to predict the sentiment of news articles.
- Provides visualizations for better understanding of the sentiment distribution.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of financial market news headlines, along with sentiment labels. The dataset includes features such as:
- **Headline**: The text of the financial news article or headline.
- **Sentiment**: Label indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Text Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary characters, stopwords, and special symbols.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into words or tokens.
- **Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for running the code.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.

## Model Performance

The model achieved an accuracy of **52%** on the test data. Various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were explored to classify the sentiment. The following steps were followed to improve the model's performance:
- Data preprocessing (cleaning and tokenization).
- Hyperparameter tuning.

Further improvements could be made by experimenting with more advanced models like LSTMs or transformers (BERT).

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd financial-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**:
   Open the `Financial_Market_News_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb` file and run the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## How to Use

1. **Preprocess the data**:
   The notebook contains steps to clean, tokenize, and vectorize the text data.

2. **Train the model**:
   The model training section will train a sentiment classifier using machine learning algorithms.

3. **Evaluate the model**:
   The results section evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy and displays the confusion matrix for better insight into predictions.

4. **Predict on new data**:
   You can modify the code to load new financial news data and predict the sentiment using the trained model.
